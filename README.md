## üìà Projects

Here is a list of the projects contained in this repository, organized chronologically. Each project has its own dedicated folder.

### 1. Titanic: Survival Prediction (Classification)
* **Description:** My first end-to-end project. We perform an EDA to find the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic and then build a Logistic Regression model to predict the outcome. A classic introduction to binary classification.
* **Articles:**
    * [Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://medium.com/@eduardo_90451/decoding-the-titanic-my-first-journey-into-exploratory-data-analysis-2726ee2a74ec)
    * [Part 2: Building the Predictive Model](https://medium.com/@eduardo_90451/decoding-the-titanic-building-a-predictive-model-50b8b4a67796)

### 2. California Housing: Price Prediction (Regression)
* **Description:** An introduction to regression models. In this project, we explore the classic California Housing dataset to uncover the drivers of real estate value and build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
* **Articles:**
    * [Part 1: An EDA of California Real Estate](https://medium.com/@eduardo_90451/location-location-data-an-analysis-of-california-housing-9d7d67922e9c)

### 3. Music Genre Classification (A Debugging Story)
* **Description:** A real-world case study in debugging. This project documents the journey of trying to classify music genres, facing unexpected failures, and making a strategic pivot to the GTZAN dataset to achieve a successful result.
* **Article:** [Sometimes You Have to Fire Your Dataset](https://medium.com/@eduardo_90451/sometimes-you-have-to-fire-your-dataset-af932e23939c)
* **Code:** [View the Project Folder](https://github.com/WafleraVertical/Blog-AI-Projects/tree/main/03-Music-Genre-Classification)

### 4. IMDB Movie Reviews: Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
* **Description:** An introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We learn how to clean and process text data, convert words into numbers using TF-IDF Vectorization, and build a model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.
* **Article:** [From Text to Sentiment: Building a Movie Review Classifier](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/can-a-machine-understand-our-opinions-building-a-movie-review-classifier-3090be49195b)

### 5. NFL Game Prediction (Feature Engineering & Optimization)
* **Description:** A multi-part project where we build a model to predict the winner of NFL games. This series focuses on moving from a simple baseline to a more powerful predictor by using advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Articles:**
    * [Part 1: An EDA of NFL Game Data](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/moneyball-for-football-can-we-predict-match-winners-with-data-416d6237e652)
    * [Part 2: Building the First Predictor](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/moneyball-for-football-can-we-predict-match-winners-with-data-53a94bcb0cc5)
    * [Part 3: Fine-Tuning for Maximum Accuracy](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/moneyball-for-football-from-a-narrow-win-to-a-dominant-strategy-a85e813b2604)

### 6. Rossmann Store Sales: Time Series Forecasting
* **Description:** An introduction to time series analysis. In this project, we explore a massive dataset of store sales to discover trends, seasonality, and other time-based patterns. This EDA serves as the foundation for building a sales forecasting model.
* **Articles:**
    * [Part 1: An EDA for Time Series Sales Data](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/finding-the-rhythm-of-business-an-eda-for-time-series-sales-data-6db299c14853)
    * [Part 2: Building a Sales Forecasting Model]() *(Coming Soon!)*
